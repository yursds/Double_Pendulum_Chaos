# Double Pendulum Chaos Theory

Here you can find the code to simulate 200 double pendulum with very small different start configuration!

To execute the simulation SFML library is necessary.  
For linux system you can install necessary package with:

    sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev

Clone the repostery:

    git clone https://github.com/yursds/double_pendulum_chaos.git

Navigate into the folder and run the following command:

    make ./main
    ./main

Click enter-space to run simulation.

You can use [header file](./include/double_pendulum.h) to change parameters of simulation.
